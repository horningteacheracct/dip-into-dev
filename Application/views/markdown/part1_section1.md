### Part 1: Technology and Terminology
or
### How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love The Code

---

## Overview
* What's the purpose of this training?
	* Help everyone do their jobs better
	* Make better and more informed choices

---

## Overview
* What will we be covering?
	* Technology and terminology
	* What they mean
	* Why it matters
	* How it's used

---

## Overview
* What is "front end" and "back end", besides an excuse to giggle in meetings?
	* Client <--> Cloud <--> Server
	* Front End refers to things that happen on the client's side (the browser)
	* Back End refers to things that happen on the server's side
	* Cloud refers to everything in between

---

## Overview
* So wait, I saw the picture, but what do you mean the "client" and "server"
	* When a user visits a web page, that users's computer can read data, format that data, and perform actions with that data
	* Front End developers deal with things that happen exclusively on the client's computer (or the front end)
	* Back End developers deal with things that happen on the server.

---

## Overview
* You guys all look the same, so if I need a developer, I can just grab one, right?
	* Nope!
	* We typically differentiates ourselves according to our specialties
	* Talk about being ramped up counting for a lot (show stats with line counts and other "impressive" metrics)
	* Front End, Back End
	* And even inside of those categories, there are specialties within those.

---

## Overview
* Why can't you just get good at all of it?
	* There's just too much!
	* There's more all the time!
	* Our brains can't fit it all.
	* Keeping up with our specialty is really hard.

---

## Overview
* So what does you guys do? Sit on the couches and play games all day?
	* I wish!
	* We do development, which means that we take mockups, ideas, and concepts and turn them into products.
	* Our products happen to be web applications or web sites (we'll use these terms interchangeably)
	* We also collaborate and bounce ideas off of each other so we do tend to talk a lot

---

## Overview
* What's a web application?
	* It's a collection of text files that computers can understand.
	* Aren't there images and fonts too? Yes.  Don't be smart.

---

## Overview
* Text files?  That's not very descriptive.  What kind of text files?
	* Well that depends on the "stack" that you are using.  (LAMP/MEAN/etc)
	* What stack do WE use? (leads into front end)
