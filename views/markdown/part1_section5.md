* Names:
	* Git
	* Mercurial
	* SVN
	* Team Foundation Server

### Version Control
* Version control is an absolutely critical part when working with a team, and even though version control makes our lives easier, more people = more harder.
* Talk about branching/branches, and why master/production dev/dev, etc.
* Why do we need it: It makes it almost impossible to ever lose work by savings *EVERY* change to *EVERY* file in a project.

---

### Version Control
* Talk about which branch means what, URLs, envs. etc.
	* Want to blame someone for your project breaking over the weekend?  Version control can do that.
	* Want to see how something worked because someone broke it?  Version control can do that.
	* Want to completely undo your changes that totally worked on your local machine but totally don't work anywhere else?  Version control can do that.

### Version Control
* GitHub
	* GitHub is the site we use to store all of our projects.
	* Most of our projects are closed source (for only us to see and use), but some are open source (open for the community to use).
	* Including this one!
	* Give out link.
