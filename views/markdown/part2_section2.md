### Exercise 1 - HTML

Everything in HTML is based on "tags".  Tags are almost always seen in sets, or as an _opening tag_ and a _closing tag_.

{{#code "html"}}
<html>
	<head>
		<!--content goes here-->
	</head>
	<body>
		<!--and also here-->
	</body>
</html>
{{/code}}

Webpages typically consist of an html, head, and body tag (as seen above).

Note: Talk about comments and their purpose.

### Exercise 1 - HTML

The head section of a website typically contains the most important information on a website, because it gets sent to the client first.

{{#code "html"}}
<html>
	<head>
		<!--meta information will go here-->
		<!--styling (CSS) will go here-->
		<!--some javascript (Interactivity) will go here-->
		<!--the __title__ of the website will go here-->
	</head>
	<body>
		<!--and also here-->
	</body>
</html>
{{/code}}

Note: Point out the title tag section, as it will be used in the example.  Also talk about the meta section and what it's used for.
